    <h1>HUGE Prized Collection SALE!!!</h1> <!--H1 Tag to get readers attention-->
    <p> <!--Create 2-3 paragraphs to describe collection-->
      This collection is very important to me. <i>However</i>, sometimes we need to
      let things go. At the same time, it is also important to allow others to enjoy
      somethings that other generations have enjoyed for many years. When it comes to this <i>
      specific collection</i>, baseball cards have been passed down through families,
      friends, or even sold for a large profit. They are something we can use to remember
      some of the greats who have played, view their stats, and have an easy keepsake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players such as <b>Derek Jeter</b>, <b>Barry Bonds</b>, <b>Jackie Robinson</b>,
      and <b>Babe Ruth</b> have helped shaped the game into what it is today.
      Outside of rememberance, the cards provide a great fun fact or talking point.
      They are also great collectibles to pass down to grandkids, sons, or anyone
      who enjoys the game of baseball.
