                    <h1>History of Sony</h1>
                    <p>
                        Sony was created shortly after World War II. The company was founded by
                        Masuaru Ibuka and Akio Morita. The first product to date was the TR-55
                        transitor radio. This was the first transitor radio to be made in the
                        country of Japan. However, the company name wasn't 'Sony' until 1958. As
                        time went on, the company kept designing and creating new ideas and 
                        technology. One of the many advancements in technology that we still use
                        to this day, the Compact Disc (CD) was developed by Sony. From there, Sony
                        wanted to keep pushing the barriers, and developed the PlayStation, a very 
                        successful gaming console, which would be furthered advanced by its successors,
                        the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and the Playstation 4. The PlayStation 2 is still
                        the best-selling home console to date. Shortly after, Sony would purchase other companies
                        and begin their adventure into the entertainment industry. Now, present day, Sony is a 
                        successful brand that is recognized worldwide, in many different shapes and forms.
